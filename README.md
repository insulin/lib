What is Insulin?
-----------------

Insulin is a developer-driven library for [![SugarCRM](https://sugarcrm-online.s3.amazonaws.com/D7-images/Sugar-LOGO-2012.png "SugarCRM")](http://sugarcrm.com). It is written with speed, flexibility and localization in mind, it also aims to ease the work of developers, in order to enable them to focus on building better and easier to maintain customizations.

Requirements
------------

Insulin library met SugarCRM at 6.1.0 version and it's still supported in latest versions, also it is meant to be used with PHP 5.3.x and up.

Although it might work with previous versions, both SugarCRM and PHP, they aren't officially supported.

Installation
------------

Installing Insulin library is a piece of cake as you can see by reading the Installation steps on the project [Wiki](http://github.com/insulin/lib/wiki/Installation).


Documentation
-------------

Although most of the code is documented, it is still a work-in-progress, besides that  the autocomplete (if you use it) will help you on how to use the several classes available. Nevertheless, we are working on a more detailed documentation with some examples and use-cases, which will be released soon.

Contributing
------------

Insulin is an open source project. If you'd like to contribute, please do so by forking the project and making pull requests and/or by creating issues on github.
